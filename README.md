# fsr - *fast spec runner*

`fsr` listens for file change events and runs RSpecs automatically in rails console avoiding the rails boot process and provides instant feedback which is crucial for Test Driven Development (TDD).

## Installation

1. Add `fsr` to your appâ€™s `Gemfile` in `test`:

   ```ruby
   group :test do
     gem 'fsr'
   end
   ```

2. Then, in your project directory:

   ```sh
   $ bundle install
   ```

## Usage

Open rails console in test environment.

```rb
 RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails c
```

All following examples should be run in this console.

### Run a single spec

```rb
listener = Fsr.listen(['spec/models/user_spec.rb'])
listener.start
```

This will listen to any file change events, automatically load the changed file and run the given spec.

To stop the listener,

```rb
listener.stop
```

By default, it listens for file change events on app/, lib/, spec/ directories. This can be overriden by passing listen option.

```rb
Fsr.listen(['spec/models/user_spec.rb'], listen: ['dir/'])
```

You can pass any RSpec command line arguments as array. For example, you can run multiple specs or run based on line number.

```rb
Fsr.listen(['spec/models/user_spec.rb:12'], listen: ['dir/'])
```
