# fsr

`fsr` listens for file change events and runs RSpecs automatically in rails console. This avoids the rails boot process and provides instant feedback which is crucial for Test Driven Development (TDD).

## Installation

1. Add `fsr` to your appâ€™s `Gemfile` in `test`:

   ```ruby
   group :test do
     gem 'fsr'
   end
   ```

2. Then, in your project directory:

   ```sh
   $ bundle install
   ```

## Usage

Open rails console in test environment.

```rb
 RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails c
```

All following examples should be run in this console.

### Run a single spec

```rb
listener = Fsr.listen(['spec/models/user_spec.rb'])
listener.start
```

This will listen to any file change events, automatically load the changed file and run the given spec.

To stop the listener,

```rb
listener.stop
```
